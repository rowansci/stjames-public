*STructured JSON Atom/Molecule Encoding Scheme*

<img src='img/james_icon.jpg' width=350>

This is the Rowan schema for passing molecule/calculation data back and forth between different parts of the software.

This is not intended to be run as a standalone library: it's basically just a big composite Pydantic model which does some validation and intelligent default selection.
(A benefit of doing validation on the client side is that it's transparent to the end userâ€”you can see all of the settings that the calculation will use.)

## Installation

To install, ensure you have Python 3.11 or newer. Then run:

```
pip install stjames
```

For bug reports, please use the Issues tab (above).

## New Releases

To release a new version, update the version number in ``pyproject.toml`` (using semantic versioning) and then issue a release with a matching version number. Github Actions will take care of the rest!
